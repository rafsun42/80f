Mars is called the Red Planet because of the reddish color imparted to its surface by the abundant iron oxide present there.[22]

Astronomical objects that are moving away from the observer exhibit a Doppler red shift.

Jupiter's surface displays a Great Red Spot caused by an oval-shaped mega storm south of the planet's equator.[23]

    Red giants are stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and switched to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell that surrounds its core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the Sun. However, their outer envelope is much lower in temperature, giving them an orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun due to their large size.

        Red supergiants like Antares, Betelgeuse, VY Canis Majoris and UY Scuti, one of the biggest stars in the Universe, are the biggest variety of red giants. They are huge in size, with radii 200 to 2600 times greater than the Sun, but relatively cool in temperature (3000â€“4500 K), causing their distinct red tint. Because they are shrinking rapidly in size, they are surrounded by an envelope or skin much bigger than the star itself. The envelope of Betelgeuse is 250 times bigger than the star inside.

A red dwarf is a small and relatively cool star, which has a mass of less than half that of the Sun and a surface temperature of less than 4,000 K. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Galaxy, but due to their low luminosity, from Earth, none are visible to the naked eye.[24]
